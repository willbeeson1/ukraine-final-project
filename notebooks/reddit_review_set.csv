2025-05-27 10:22:55,worldnews,comment,I don't know if i would call China part of the 'axis' like the others involved here. China like wont really dissuade russia or any of them from fucking with the west and will help them to its benefit. However I don't think they would like throw themselves into a war with them (mostly cause i think they would hedge their bets and join whoever gives them the greater benefits and Russia and the DPRK losing i think is like basically china's wet dream)

2025-05-27 05:51:19,worldnews,comment,"A consequence of European countries actively disemboweling their own militaries for the last 30 years and needing to catch up in a somewhat timely fashion.

They can either massively increase spending and be less dependent on the US in defending themselves against Russia, or choose to continue being extremely dependent on the US and therefore also outsourcing foreign policy and national security to POTUS.

Most likely situation is of course a mix of both, as few European countries are even capable of spending 3.5% without either deeply unpopular tax increases or deeply unpopular cuts in other spending (e.g. social security)."
2025-05-26 03:56:20,worldnews,comment,"> The internal document seen by Reuters, titled ""Directive Priorities for the Bolstering of Readiness"" and signed on May 19, outlines a detailed roadmap to prepare Germanyâ€™s armed forces over the next five years.

> The directive reflects shared assessments by Breuer and NATO officials that Russia may have rebuilt its military enough to pose a direct threat to the allianceâ€™s borders. Funding for the plan will come from the loosening of Germanyâ€™s ""debt brake"" in March, which allows additional defense spending

> The document sets acquisition priorities that align with NATOâ€™s recommendations. Chief among them is strengthening Germanyâ€™s air defenses, with particular emphasis on countering drones. NATO is expected to ask Berlin to at least quadruple its air defense systems, ranging from long-range platforms such as the Patriot to short-range interceptors

> In addition to bolstering aerial defenses, the directive calls for capabilities to conduct deep precision strikes against targets more than 500 kilometers away. Breuer also emphasized the urgency of replenishing Germanyâ€™s ammunition stockpiles and increasing stockpiling targets across all ammunition types.

> Other key areas for development include enhancing electronic warfare systems and building a robust set of both offensive and defensive capabilities in space."

2025-05-26 11:48:50,worldnews,comment,"Germany does not have to pretend they have to fight Russia on their own, and you would got get crushed by drones. Ukraine managed in few weeks to build up somewhat reliable air defense with our leftover equipment.

Germany is not adjacent to Russia, and drones sounds great until you realise Germany is one of the worlds largest producers of mobile air defense of the type that is most effective and cost efficient vs drones. 

They claimed they had 700.000 soldiers in Ukraine, but it came at the expense at being unable to defend their home territory in Kursk in an incursion that lasted 8 month and required Russia to withdraw significant troops from Ukraine AND the help of North Korea.   
They also surrendered the control of Syria, so there is nothing that indicates they have any significant resources in the stockpile except ICBMs of which 5 out of 6 last tests resulted in failures, and the last one only flew about 20 miles.

I am not sure Russia would succeed if it was just Germany. I think the odds of them securing their border on a full blown engagement on EU is litterally 0.   
Poland and Ukraine was roughly the same military size before the war, except Poland had significantly more modern equipment. 

Now imagine Russia attacking Poland, and have to spend any meaningful time there, how will they defend their own country from Finland and Sweden up north. 12 stormshadows took out an entire command center. Imagine that them have to defend against 1200.

But the thing is Russia is not even capable of attacking Poland currently, cause right now the majority of their active army is struggling to gain momentum in Ukraine, and proably will be for the forseeable future. 

So stop the fearmongering, the situation is bad enough as it is, Russia is not even the biggest threat to EU currently"
2025-05-26 11:54:08,worldnews,comment,All of them are collapsing in the polls and have terms ending. A war guarantees they remain in power
2025-05-27 10:59:19,worldnews,comment,"North Korea yeah thats obvious they have sent millions of shells and 10k soldiers. Iran sure they have sent massive amounts of missiles and drones & drone tech. But these statements never tell us what exactly is China providing to Russia en mass that other countries dont to a smaller degree or that China doesnt also provide to Ukraine to the degree Ukraine can afford it. Drone parts and electronics? China provide to both sides of the war all the same and other countries provide them to Russia as well pretty freely? Chemicals and rare earths used for weapons ? Again all Ukraine is free to buy and does buy the same shit Russia does and so do Ukrainian allies, hell NATO probably buys more of China's chemicals, electronics and rare earths for their production than Russia does. The American weapon manufacturing is mostly based on Chinese imputs as well.

So how does this designation makes sense? If its based on what they sell to Russia and what russia makes with what it imports from China then by the same standard that China is in the axis together with Russia against Ukraine they are also in the alliance with Nato and Ukraine against Russia. China doesnt follow western sanctions on Russia but so does like hald of the world? Is half of the world in the axis against Ukraine??"

2025-05-27 13:29:22,worldnews,comment,"So they're aware, but they're not sanctioning those countries.  All of those countries deserve the most severe sanctions and boycotts.  It's the height of stupidity for any NATO country to trade with the enemy and help build their economies which funds their militaries.

Also, the axis is not limed to cooperation just in Ukraine.  They cooperate worldwide."

2025-05-26 21:28:51,worldnews,comment,"I never said they would make intelligent decisions sir. But to be fair you do know the EUs arms production and military is terrible compared to Russia, who has had like 3+ years to transition to wartime economy

I hate this narrative that Russia is weak because it will only do harm underestimating them. If the US is fighting China, they would also aid Russia in their front. Itâ€™s a world war scenario.  And you should know historically that the amount of the population currently conscripted into their forces is chump change compared to how many they are willing to lose. Russians are willing to vaporize their population to get a win."

2025-05-27 09:07:39,worldnews,comment,"Stupid. 

Russia is in a full blown war and is only at 7-8%. 

The 2% benchmark was reasonable and itâ€™s a scandal so many - including Netherlands throughout Rutteâ€™s long premiership- werenâ€™t/arenâ€™t meeting it. Fixing that should be the immediate priority.

Then aim for 2.5% as a minimum. Some will spend much more and thatâ€™s fine; threat realities vary by geography. But NATO members also face huge challenges around fiscal consolidation so tying themselves to needlessly high targets they very publicly wonâ€™t meet (yet again) is just weird. 

The implication is also that this is something Trump has called for so everyone needs to play along. The US is a high spender but way short of 5%, and wonâ€™t get there either without raising taxes enormously."
